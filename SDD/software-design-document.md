# 1. System Design

## 1.1 System Architecture

The Hotel Marketplace Management System is designed as a multi-tenant client-server application. The target operating environment from the SRS is Flutter for the mobile client, ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend, Clean Architecture for the backend design style, Microsoft SQL Server for persistence, payOS for online payment, and a mock or future notification provider for notification delivery.

Because no repository/codebase was provided for this draft, package names, class names, endpoint names, and table names are design proposals derived from the SRS. They must be revalidated against the actual implementation before final submission.

### 1.1.1 Architecture Style

| Design Area | Decision | Rationale | Related SRS Items |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall style | Client-server with backend API and mobile client | Fits Flutter client + ASP.NET Core Web API operating environment. | NFR-COMP-001, NFR-SEC-001 |
| Backend layering | Clean Architecture | Separates API, application logic, domain rules, and infrastructure concerns. | SRS 1.4, NFR-MAINT-001 |
| Tenancy model | Hotel-scoped multi-tenant access | Property Owner and staff access must be restricted by owned/assigned hotel. | BR-OWNER-001, BR-STAFF-002, NFR-SEC-002 |
| Booking availability | Hybrid availability model | Marketplace booking reserves room type quantity/date; physical room assignment occurs before or during check-in. | UC-005, UC-013, UC-015, UC-029, DEC-002 |
| Payment | Dual payment mode | Platform Collect uses payOS; Pay at Property uses hotel-side collection records. | UC-006, UC-030, BR-PAY-004 |
| Notification | Event-based notification record with optional external delivery | MVP can record notifications even if external delivery is mocked. | NSF-003, BR-NOTI-001 |
| Finance operation | Manual refund, settlement, reconciliation marking | SRS confirms MVP manual finance operations by Platform Administrator. | UC-020, UC-021, UC-022 |

### 1.1.2 Main Components

| Component | Type | Responsibility | Communicates With | Related Requirements |

## 1.2 Package Diagram

The following package design follows Clean Architecture. Names are proposed conceptual package names and must be aligned with the actual codebase when implementation exists.

| No | Package / Namespace | Description | Key Classes / Files | Depends On |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `Presentation.Api` | HTTP controllers, request/response contracts, authentication filters, and API configuration. | AuthController, BookingController, HotelController, StaffController, FinanceController | `Application` |
| 02 | `Application` | Use case services, command/query handlers, validators, DTOs, transaction orchestration, and authorization checks. | AuthService, BookingService, AvailabilityService, FrontDeskService, FinanceService | `Domain`, repository abstractions |
| 03 | `Domain` | Domain entities, value objects, enumerations, and business rule methods. | Booking, RoomType, PhysicalRoom, CommissionRecord, HousekeepingTask | None |
| 04 | `Infrastructure.Persistence` | SQL Server database context, repository implementations, migrations, and persistence configuration. | AppDbContext, BookingRepository, RoomRepository, PaymentRepository | `Application`, `Domain` |

## 1.3 Cross-Cutting Design

### 1.3.1 Authentication and Authorization

| Concern | Design |
|---|---|
| Authentication | Protected functions require authenticated user session/token. Exact token/session mechanism is implementation-specific and must be confirmed from code. |
| Role authorization | User roles include Customer, Property Owner, Hotel Manager, Receptionist, Housekeeping Staff, Maintenance Staff, and Platform Administrator. |
| Hotel scope | Hotel-scoped staff access is checked through `HotelStaffAssignment` or equivalent assignment data. |
| Manager staff authority | Hotel Manager can manage staff within assigned hotel but cannot grant Property Owner or Platform Administrator authority. |
| Platform separation | Platform Administrator can perform platform approval and finance administration but does not automatically receive hotel operational authority unless explicitly modeled. |
| Privacy | Housekeeping and Maintenance roles receive minimum room/task data and no payment/refund/commission/settlement detail. |

### 1.3.2 Validation Strategy

| Validation Area | Enforced In | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Request shape and mandatory fields | API/Application validators | Required account, hotel, room, booking, payment, and staff fields. |
| Domain/business rules | Domain/Application services | Date range, availability, room assignment overlap, status transitions, commission range. |
| Authorization/scope | Application authorization checks | Customer owns booking, staff assigned to hotel, manager permission. |
| Financial integrity | Application services and database constraints | Duplicate payment callback protection, commission snapshot, settlement eligibility. |

### 1.3.3 Transaction Strategy

| Use Case Area | Transaction Boundary | Consistency Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Create Booking | Booking header, booking room, availability reservation, initial payment/commission state where applicable | No confirmed/pending booking without consistent availability reservation. |
| Payment Notification | Payment transaction, booking status, commission record, audit/notification | Duplicate notifications must not double-confirm or double-count. |
| Check-in | Booking status, room assignment, guest stay record, room status history, audit | Physical room cannot overlap active stay. |
| Check-out | Booking/stay status, invoice/folio, payment collection if required, room status, housekeeping task | Checkout creates cleaning path and preserves finance traceability. |
| Staff Assignment | Staff account/invitation, role assignment, audit | Staff cannot receive authority outside allowed role and hotel scope. |
| Refund/Settlement | Refund/settlement/commission status, admin note, audit | Manual finance actions are traceable and cannot bypass eligibility. |

# 2. Database Design

## 2.1 Database Overview

The SDD database design is derived from the SRS logical entities. It proposes SQL Server relational tables for implementation. Table and column names must be adjusted to match the actual codebase and migration style when available.

### 2.1.1 Data Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| Multi-tenant hotel scope | Hotel-owned data includes `HotelId` and is filtered by ownership or staff assignment. |
| Historical traceability | Booking, payment, commission, settlement, room status, housekeeping, maintenance, and audit records preserve status history. |
| Finance separation | payOS online payments use payment transactions; Pay at Property uses hotel-side collection records. |
| Hybrid availability | Public booking uses room type quantity/date availability; physical rooms are assigned later and validated for overlap/status. |
| Sensitive data minimization | Identity document data is basic and limited to authorized front desk/manager/owner access. |
| Auditability | Protected operational and financial actions create audit records. |

## 2.2 Database Table Relationship

The database relationship design mirrors the SRS logical ERD:

- `UserAccounts` has many `HotelStaffAssignments`, `StaffInvitations`, `Bookings`, and audit actions.
- `HotelProperties` belongs to a Property Owner and has many room types, physical rooms, staff assignments, bookings, housekeeping tasks, maintenance requests, commissions, and settlements.
- `RoomTypes` has many `PhysicalRooms`, `RoomAvailabilities`, and `BookingRooms`.
- `Bookings` has one or more supporting records: booking room line, optional physical room assignments, payment transactions, collection records, refund record, invoice, commission record, notification records, and audit records.
- `PhysicalRooms` has status history, housekeeping tasks, maintenance requests, and booking assignments.
- Finance records connect booking, payment, commission, settlement header, and settlement items.

# 3. Detailed Design

The following detailed design sections are integrated from the prepared SDD assets under `sdd_assets/`. The class names, method names, and interaction flows are conceptual design assumptions derived from the SRS because no implementation codebase was inspected. They must be revalidated against the final source code before implementation or final submission.

## 3.1 UC-001 - Search Hotels

#### 3.1.1 Design Purpose

This section describes the detailed design for **UC-001 Search Hotels**. The use case allows Guest and Customer actors to search approved hotels by destination, stay dates, guest count, and filters. The design is based on the SRS only; class names and methods are conceptual design assumptions and must be revalidated against the final codebase.

**Related SRS items:** FEAT-MKT, UC-001, SCR-004, SCR-005, ENT-005, ENT-007, ENT-008, ENT-010, ENT-011, ENT-012, BR-MKT-001, BR-BOOK-001, BR-ROOM-002, MSG-MKT-001, MSG-BOOK-001, TR-001, AT-UC001-04A, AT-UC001-05A.

The search flow must:

- Accept public search criteria from Guest or Customer.
- Validate destination, check-in date, check-out date, and guest count before querying.
- Return only approved and published hotels.
- Include only room types that can satisfy the selected date range and guest count.
- Use the hybrid availability decision: marketplace search checks room type quantity/date; physical room assignment is deferred to front desk check-in flow.

#### 3.1.2 Class Diagram

This part presents the class diagram for the Search Hotels use case.

![DGM-CLS-UC-001 - Search Hotels Class Diagram](sdd_assets/uc-001-search-hotels/dgm-cls-uc-001-search-hotels-class-diagram.png)

#### 3.1.4 Sequence Diagram

This part presents the sequence diagrams for UC-001 Search Hotels. The main-flow diagram shows only the successful scenario. Each alternative/error scenario has its own diagram.

![DGM-SEQ-UC-001 - Search Hotels Main Flow](sdd_assets/uc-001-search-hotels/dgm-seq-uc-001-search-hotels-main-flow.png)

**Figure 3.1-2: Sequence Diagram of UC-001 Search Hotels - Main Flow**

### AT-UC001-04A - Invalid Date Range

- **Branch from Main Step:** 4
- **Condition:** Invalid date range.
- **Expected Response:** Check-out date must be later than check-in date.

![DGM-SEQ-UC-001 - Invalid Date Range](sdd_assets/uc-001-search-hotels/dgm-seq-uc-001-search-hotels-at-uc001-04a-invalid-date-range.png)

![DGM-SEQ-UC-001 - No Matching Hotels](sdd_assets/uc-001-search-hotels/dgm-seq-uc-001-search-hotels-at-uc001-05a-no-matching-hotels.png)

**Figure 3.1-4: Sequence Diagram of UC-001 Search Hotels - AT-UC001-05A No Matching Hotels**

### Validation, Authorization, Transaction, and Error Handling Notes

| Area | Design |
|---|---|
| Validation | Validate date range, guest count, destination/filter values, and pagination/sorting parameters if present. Check-in date must be before check-out date. Guest count must be positive. |
| Authorization | UC-001 is public. Guest and Customer can search. The API must not expose management-only fields or unpublished hotel data. |
| Transaction | Search is read-only and does not create booking, payment, or room assignment records. No write transaction is required. |
| Availability Consistency | Use room type/date availability for marketplace search. Physical room assignment is outside this use case and belongs to front desk/check-in design. |
| Error Handling | Return validation errors for invalid criteria, empty results for no matches, and safe generic error responses for unexpected repository/service failures. |
| Privacy | Do not expose owner/staff private data, internal notes, audit records, or unpublished hotel configuration in the public search response. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- Exact API route, DTO field names, and repository names are conceptual because no codebase was inspected.
- The SRS confirms search by destination, dates, guest count, and filters, but does not define all filter fields; later detailed design should align filter fields with UI mockups and final database schema.
- Alternative/error sequence flows are separated from the main flow to keep diagrams readable and avoid inaccurate combined-fragment rendering.

# 3.2 UC-002 - View Hotel Detail

## 3.2.1 Design Purpose

This section describes the detailed design for **UC-002 View Hotel Detail**. The use case allows Guest and Customer actors to open a marketplace hotel listing and view approved hotel detail, images, amenities, cancellation policy, room types, base prices, and availability information. The design is based on the SRS only; class names and methods are conceptual design assumptions and must be revalidated against the final codebase.

**Related SRS items:** FEAT-MKT, UC-002, SCR-006, ENT-005, ENT-006, ENT-007, ENT-008, ENT-009, ENT-010, ENT-011, ENT-012, BR-MKT-001, BR-AUTH-001, BR-ROOM-002, MSG-MKT-002, MSG-AUTH-002, TR-002, AT-UC002-02A, AT-UC002-05A.

The hotel detail flow must:

- Load only approved, active, and publicly available hotel properties.
- Display hotel profile, gallery images, amenities, cancellation policy summary, and contact information.
- Display room types with capacity, base price, and selected-date availability when dates are provided.
- Allow an authenticated Customer to choose an available room type and continue to booking.
- Guide a Guest to login or registration before booking.
- Avoid creating booking data during hotel detail browsing.

## 3.2.4 Sequence Diagram

This part presents the sequence diagrams for UC-002 View Hotel Detail. The main-flow diagram shows only the successful scenario. Each alternative/error scenario has its own diagram.

**Figure 3.2-2: Sequence Diagram of UC-002 View Hotel Detail - Main Flow**

### AT-UC002-02A - Hotel No Longer Available

- **Branch from Main Step:** 2
- **Condition:** Hotel no longer available.
- **Expected Response:** This hotel is no longer available for public booking.

![DGM-SEQ-UC-002 - Hotel No Longer Available](sdd_assets/uc-002-view-hotel-detail/dgm-seq-uc-002-view-hotel-detail-at-uc002-02a-hotel-no-longer-available.png)

### AT-UC002-05A - Guest Selects Booking

- **Branch from Main Step:** 5
- **Condition:** Guest selects booking.
- **Expected Response:** Please log in or register before creating a booking.

**Figure 3.2-4: Sequence Diagram of UC-002 View Hotel Detail - AT-UC002-05A Guest Selects Booking**

### Validation, Authorization, Transaction, and Error Handling Notes

| Area | Design |
|---|---|
| Validation | Validate hotel identifier, optional check-in/check-out date range, guest count when present, and selected room type before booking handoff. Date-range validation is applied only when dates are provided for availability display. |
| Authorization | Viewing hotel detail is public for Guest and Customer, but BR-MKT-001 restricts output to approved, active, and publicly available hotels. Booking continuation requires authenticated Customer status under BR-AUTH-001. |
| Transaction | UC-002 is read-only for hotel detail browsing. Selecting a room type only prepares a booking handoff and must not create booking, payment, assignment, or invoice records. |
| Availability Consistency | Availability is shown at room type/date level for marketplace browsing. Physical room assignment remains outside UC-002 and belongs to later booking/front desk flows. |
| Error Handling | If the hotel is no longer public, return MSG-MKT-002 and guide the actor back to search. If a Guest selects booking, return MSG-AUTH-002 and guide the actor to login/register before booking. If a selected room type is unavailable, later booking flow must handle MSG-BOOK-002. |
| Privacy | Do not expose owner/staff private data, unpublished hotel configuration, internal notes, audit records, or non-public operational room details on SCR-006. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- ASSUMP-UC002-001: Exact API route, DTO field names, repository names, and method signatures are conceptual because no implementation codebase was inspected.
- ASSUMP-UC002-002: `CancellationPolicy` is included in the detail design because SCR-006 displays a cancellation policy summary, even though ENT-009 is primarily listed under booking/customer booking management features.
- ASSUMP-UC002-003: Room availability displayed on the hotel detail screen is a read-only room type availability summary; physical room assignment is deferred to booking/front desk designs.
- ASSUMP-UC002-004: `HotelContentSummary` summarizes `HotelImage`, `Amenity`, `HotelAmenity`, and `CancellationPolicy` in the class diagram to keep the diagram readable while preserving SRS traceability.
- OQ-UC002-001: The SRS does not specify whether SCR-006 should display room types without selected dates as “date required” or as base information without availability quantity.

**Figure 3.7-5: Sequence Diagram of UC-007 Cancel Booking - AT-UC007-06B Refund review required**

### Validation, Authorization, Transaction, and Error Handling Notes

| Area | Design |
|---|---|
| Validation | Validate required input, current entity status, date/amount/reference values, and SRS business rules before any state change. |
| Authorization | Allow only the SRS actor scope for Customer; enforce role, ownership, hotel-scope, or platform-scope preconditions before protected data is displayed or changed. |
| Transaction | Use a single application transaction for validated state changes, persistence updates, audit records, and notification records where applicable. Read-only flows do not create domain records. |
| Error Handling | AT-UC007-04A returns "This booking cannot be cancelled according to its current status or policy."; AT-UC007-06A returns "Refund is marked Not Required and cancellation continues."; AT-UC007-06B returns "Refund request is under review by the platform.". |
| Privacy | Return only fields allowed for the current role and scope; staff roles must not receive unrelated customer, platform finance, or cross-hotel data. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

**Related SRS items:** FEAT-FRONTDESK, UC-014, SCR-020, SCR-021, ENT-013, BR-BOOK-009, BR-OWNER-001, BR-STAFF-002, BR-STAFF-003, MSG-BOOK-009, MSG-OWNER-002, TR-014, AT-UC014-02A, AT-UC014-04A.

**Precondition:** Actor authenticated and has hotel access.

**Trigger:** Actor opens Hotel Booking List.

**Post-condition:** POS-01: Hotel-scoped booking list or booking detail is displayed according to actor permission.

The flow must:

- Main step 1: Actor opens Hotel Booking List.
- Main step 2: System validates actor role and hotel access, then displays hotel selector, filters, and booking list for permitted hotels.
- Main step 3: Actor applies filters or selects booking.
- Main step 4: System displays booking detail and actions allowed for actor role.
- Main step 5: Actor chooses next operational action if needed.
- Enforce related business rules: BR-BOOK-009, BR-OWNER-001, BR-STAFF-002, BR-STAFF-003.
- Return a separate scenario response for each alternative/error flow: AT-UC014-02A, AT-UC014-04A.

### Validation, Authorization, Transaction, and Error Handling Notes

| Area | Design |
|---|---|
| Validation | Validate required input, current entity status, date/amount/reference values, and SRS business rules before any state change. |
| Authorization | Allow only the SRS actor scope for Receptionist / Hotel Manager / Property Owner; enforce role, ownership, hotel-scope, or platform-scope preconditions before protected data is displayed or changed. |
| Transaction | Use a single application transaction for validated state changes, persistence updates, audit records, and notification records where applicable. Read-only flows do not create domain records. |
| Error Handling | AT-UC016-05A returns "Only checked-in bookings can be checked out."; AT-UC016-05B returns "Please confirm payment collection before checkout."; AT-UC016-06A returns "The selected room status transition is not allowed.". |
| Privacy | Return only fields allowed for the current role and scope; staff roles must not receive unrelated customer, platform finance, or cross-hotel data. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- ASSUMP-UC016-001: Controller, service, repository, DTO, and entity class names are conceptual SDD design names because no source implementation was inspected.
- ASSUMP-UC016-002: Final API routes, database column names, and UI widget names may differ from these SDD class names but must preserve the traced SRS behavior.
- OQ-UC016-001: Confirm final implementation class/package names before treating the conceptual design as code-level documentation.

**Precondition:** Actor authenticated; booking exists for a hotel the actor owns or is assigned to.

**Trigger:** Actor selects Mark No-show.

**Post-condition:** POS-01: Booking status becomes No-show and financial traceability is preserved.

The flow must:

- Main step 1: Actor opens booking detail or no-show candidate action.
- Main step 2: System validates actor role, hotel scope, and booking access before showing no-show details.
- Main step 3: System displays no-show eligibility, policy summary, and reason field.
- Main step 4: Actor selects Mark No-show and enters reason.
- Main step 5: System validates booking status, no-show eligibility, and required reason.
- Main step 6: System updates booking to No-show.
- Main step 7: System releases reserved availability, releases any pre-assigned physical room, and keeps finance records according to policy.
- Main step 8: System records audit and sends or records notification.
- Main step 9: System displays no-show success.
- Enforce related business rules: BR-STAY-004, BR-BOOK-009, BR-FIN-004, BR-STAY-007, BR-STAFF-002, BR-STAFF-003.
- Return a separate scenario response for each alternative/error flow: AT-UC017-05A, AT-UC017-05B, AT-UC017-05C, AT-UC017-02A.

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- ASSUMP-UC019-001: Controller, service, repository, DTO, and entity class names are conceptual SDD design names because no source implementation was inspected.
- ASSUMP-UC019-002: Final API routes, database column names, and UI widget names may differ from these SDD class names but must preserve the traced SRS behavior.
- OQ-UC019-001: Confirm final implementation class/package names before treating the conceptual design as code-level documentation.

**Precondition:** Platform Administrator authenticated; payment transaction exists.

**Trigger:** Admin opens Payment Reconciliation.

**Post-condition:** POS-01: Payment transaction reconciliation status is updated and audit is recorded.

The flow must:

- Main step 1: Platform Administrator admin opens Payment Reconciliation.

- Main step 6: System validates decision, required note, current reconciliation state, and duplicate/concurrent update guard.
- Main step 7: System records reconciliation status and audit if the transaction is still eligible for update.
- Continue through the remaining SRS main-flow steps until the UC-020 post-condition is reached.
- Enforce related business rules: BR-PAY-003, BR-FIN-002, BR-ADMIN-003, BR-AUDIT-001.
- Return a separate scenario response for each alternative/error flow: AT-UC020-06A, AT-UC020-06B.

| Authorization | Allow only Receptionist, Hotel Manager, Property Owner according to the SRS actor, role, hotel-scope, or platform-scope precondition. |
| Transaction | Use a single application transaction for validated state changes, persistence updates, audit records, and notification records where applicable. |
| Error Handling | AT-UC031-06A returns "The selected room is no longer available for the selected dates."; AT-UC031-05A returns "Please enter required guest contact information."; AT-UC031-02A returns "Walk-in booking is not enabled for this hotel or role."; AT-UC031-07A returns "The selected room is no longer available for the selected dates."; AT-UC031-07B returns "The selected room is no longer available for the selected dates.". |
| Privacy | Return only fields allowed for the current role and scope; staff roles must not receive unrelated customer, platform finance, or cross-hotel data. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- ASSUMP-UC031-001: Controller, service, repository, DTO, and entity class names are conceptual SDD design names because no source implementation was inspected.
- ASSUMP-UC031-002: Final API routes, database column names, and UI widget names may differ from these SDD class names but must preserve the traced SRS behavior.
- OQ-UC031-001: Confirm final implementation class/package names before treating the conceptual design as code-level documentation.

### Validation, Authorization, Transaction, and Error Handling Notes

| Area | Design |
|---|---|
| Validation | Validate required input, current entity status, date/amount/reference values, and SRS business rules before any state change. |
| Authorization | Allow only Housekeeping Staff, Receptionist, Hotel Manager according to the SRS actor, role, hotel-scope, or platform-scope precondition. |
| Transaction | Use a single application transaction for validated state changes, persistence updates, audit records, and notification records where applicable. |
| Error Handling | AT-UC034-05A returns "Please enter required room issue information."; AT-UC034-07A returns "Please enter required room issue information."; AT-UC034-02A returns "You are not authorized to perform this action.". |
| Privacy | Return only fields allowed for the current role and scope; staff roles must not receive unrelated customer, platform finance, or cross-hotel data. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- ASSUMP-UC034-001: Controller, service, repository, DTO, and entity class names are conceptual SDD design names because no source implementation was inspected.
- ASSUMP-UC034-002: Final API routes, database column names, and UI widget names may differ from these SDD class names but must preserve the traced SRS behavior.
- OQ-UC034-001: Confirm final implementation class/package names before treating the conceptual design as code-level documentation.

# 3.35 UC-035 - View Maintenance Requests

## 3.35.1 Design Purpose

This section describes the detailed design for **UC-035 View Maintenance Requests**. The use case covers View open, assigned, and resolved maintenance requests for assigned hotels. The design is based on the SRS/SDD only; class names and methods are conceptual design assumptions because no implementation codebase was inspected.

**Related SRS items:** FEAT-MAINTENANCE, UC-035, SCR-033, ENT-026, BR-MAINT-001, BR-STAFF-002, BR-STAFF-006, MSG-MAINT-003, MSG-AUTH-007, TR-035, AT-UC035-03A, AT-UC035-02A.

**Precondition:** Actor authenticated; hotel assignment and maintenance visibility can be validated before list display.

**Trigger:** Actor opens Maintenance Request List.

**Post-condition:** POS-01: Authorized maintenance requests are displayed.

The flow must:

- Main step 1: Actor opens Maintenance Request List.
- Main step 2: System validates actor role, hotel assignment, and maintenance visibility scope.
- Main step 3: System displays requests by room, severity, status, assignee, and date.
- Main step 4: Actor filters or selects request.
- Main step 5: System validates selected request access and displays request detail with allowed actions.
- Enforce related business rules: BR-MAINT-001, BR-STAFF-002, BR-STAFF-006.
- Return a separate scenario response for each alternative/error flow: AT-UC035-03A, AT-UC035-02A.

### Validation, Authorization, Transaction, and Error Handling Notes

| Area | Design |
|---|---|
| Validation | Validate required input, current entity status, date/amount/reference values, and SRS business rules before any state change. |
| Authorization | Allow only Maintenance Staff, Hotel Manager according to the SRS actor, role, hotel-scope, or platform-scope precondition. |
| Transaction | Use a single application transaction for validated state changes, persistence updates, audit records, and notification records where applicable. |
| Error Handling | AT-UC037-05A returns "Maintenance must be completed before the room can be released."; AT-UC037-05B returns "Manager approval is required before releasing this room."; AT-UC037-02A returns "You are not authorized to perform this action.". |
| Privacy | Return only fields allowed for the current role and scope; staff roles must not receive unrelated customer, platform finance, or cross-hotel data. |

## Assumptions and Open Issues

- ASSUMP-UC037-001: Controller, service, repository, DTO, and entity class names are conceptual SDD design names because no source implementation was inspected.
- ASSUMP-UC037-002: Final API routes, database column names, and UI widget names may differ from these SDD class names but must preserve the traced SRS behavior.
- OQ-UC037-001: Confirm final implementation class/package names before treating the conceptual design as code-level documentation.
